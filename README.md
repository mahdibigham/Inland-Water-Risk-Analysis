# Inland Water Risk Analysis
### Predictive Drowning Risk Assessment – Proof of Concept

This repository presents a proof-of-concept project focused on predicting drowning risk in inland water environments such as lakes and reservoirs.

The goal of this work is not to detect drowning incidents after they occur, but to estimate risk levels in advance by analyzing environmental conditions. The project is intended as an early-stage applied research prototype with potential relevance for water safety, lifeguard support, and preventive decision-making systems.

## Background
Inland waters are often considered safer than open seas, yet drowning incidents still occur regularly in these environments. 
Safety assessments are typically based on visual observation and individual experience, which may not fully capture rapidly changing environmental conditions.

This project explores how environmental data can be translated into a simple and interpretable risk indicator that supports preventive safety decisions.

---

## Project Scope
- Focus on **inland waters** (lakes, reservoirs, calm recreational waters)
- Emphasis on **risk prediction before incidents**, not post-event detection
- Prioritization of **interpretability and transparency** over model complexity
- Use of synthetic or open-access data for early validation

This repository represents an initial research step rather than a finished product.

## Method Overview
The current implementation follows a structured analytical pipeline:

1. Simulation or collection of environmental parameters  
2. Feature-based risk scoring using defined assumptions  
3. Aggregation of scores into a total risk index  
4. Classification into qualitative risk levels:
   - Low
   - Medium
   - High

The logic is intentionally kept lightweight to allow inspection, validation, and discussion.

---

## Current Status
- Proof-of-concept logic implemented
- Synthetic data used for testing and demonstration
- No real-world deployment or operational validation yet

The project is under active conceptual development and is intended for academic discussion and further research.

---

## Limitations
- Environmental data is simulated and does not represent real-time measurements
- The model does not account for individual swimmer behavior
- Risk thresholds are heuristic and subject to future calibration

These limitations are acknowledged as part of the early research stage.

---

## Future Directions
Possible future extensions include:
- Integration with real-time meteorological data sources
- Validation using real-world inland water datasets
- Collaboration with water safety professionals
- Exploration of wearable or augmented reality interfaces for real-time risk visualization

---

## Intended Use
This repository is intended for:
- Academic research discussions
- Research-based MSc or PhD exploration
- Concept validation prior to real-world studies

It is not designed for operational or safety-critical deployment at this stage.
