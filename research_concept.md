Concept Note: IWRAS Pilot on Lake Victoria
Focus: Translating Hydro-Meteorological Data into Artisanal Fishery Safety Decisions
1. The Problem (The "Why")
Lake Victoria suffers from high fatality rates among artisanal fishers due to sudden nocturnal convective storms. While TAHMO provides high-fidelity weather data, there is a "Translation Gap": raw data (e.g., wind speed in m/s) is not intuitively actionable for a local fisher at 2:00 AM.
2. The Proposed Logic (The "How")
IWRAS (Inland Water Risk Assessment System) is a decision-support layer that processes raw sensing data into a 3-level Safety Integrity Index:
•	Green: Safe for all vessels.
•	Yellow: Caution for small wooden boats (artisanal fleet).
•	Red: High risk of capsize; return to shore immediately.
3. The Specific Pilot Case (The "What")
Instead of a complex hardware deployment, I propose a Data-Driven Feasibility Study focused on the Entebbe/Lake Victoria region:
•	Objective: To determine if the IWRAS logic can accurately "predict" historical capsize events using TAHMO's archived data.
•	Method:
1.	Select 3 stations with high-resolution logging.
2.	Apply the IWRAS algorithm to identify "Risk Spikes" during past storm events.
3.	Calibrate the "Red Alert" thresholds specifically for the low-stability wooden boats used locally.
4. Current Status (The "Honesty")
The project is currently a Functional Prototype (Proof of Concept) validated in a simulated environment. This pilot is intended to:
1.	Verify the algorithm against real-world tropical lake dynamics.
2.	Refine the risk thresholds under the scientific guidance of the TAHMO team.
5. Why Me?
As a Computer Engineer with 16 years of operational experience, my contribution is the Algorithmic Implementation and Edge-Computing readiness. I am seeking your expertise to ground this logic in hydrological reality.
