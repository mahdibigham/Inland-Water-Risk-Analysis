## Predictive Risk Assessment for Drowning Prevention in Inland Waters

### 1. Motivation
Drowning incidents in inland waters such as lakes and reservoirs continue to occur despite the presence of basic safety measures. 
These environments are often perceived as low-risk compared to open seas, which leads to limited use of advanced monitoring or early warning systems.

In most cases, safety decisions are based on visual observation and personal experience. 
While valuable, these approaches do not account for rapidly changing environmental conditions and offer little support for anticipating risk before an incident occurs.

This research is motivated by the need for a practical and preventive approach that can assist lifeguards and safety authorities in identifying hazardous conditions in advance.

### 2. Problem Statement
At present, there is no widely adopted system that translates environmental conditions in inland waters into a clear, real-time assessment of drowning risk. 
Lifeguards must interpret multiple factors simultaneously, often under time pressure and uncertain conditions.

The absence of data-driven decision support tools increases the likelihood of delayed reactions and preventable accidents. 
This research addresses the gap between available environmental data and its practical use for preventive water safety.

### 3. Research Questions
This study seeks to answer the following questions:
- How can environmental conditions be translated into a meaningful indicator of drowning risk in inland waters?
- Which environmental factors contribute most significantly to increased risk?
- Can a simple and interpretable model provide sufficient accuracy for preventive safety decisions?
- How can risk information be presented in a way that supports fast and reliable human judgment?

### 4. Research Hypothesis
The central hypothesis of this research is that a combination of environmental parameters—such as wind speed, water temperature, visibility, and time-related factors—can be used to estimate drowning risk levels before an incident occurs.

It is further assumed that transparent and rule-based or lightweight machine learning models are more suitable than complex black-box models for safety-critical applications.

### 5. Conceptual Methodology
The proposed methodology follows a step-by-step analytical process:
1. Collection of environmental data from open-access sources or controlled simulations
2. Data preprocessing and feature extraction to describe environmental stability
3. Risk estimation using interpretable analytical or machine learning models
4. Classification of conditions into discrete risk levels (Low, Medium, High)
5. Communication of risk levels through a simple user interface

At this stage, synthetic data is used to validate the logic and structure of the approach.

### 6. Focus on Inland Waters
Inland waters are selected as the primary focus due to their relatively stable conditions and high relevance to public safety. 
They provide an appropriate environment for early-stage research, model validation, and gradual system refinement.

This focus also reflects a practical pathway toward real-world deployment without introducing unnecessary complexity at the initial research stage.

### 7. Interpretability and Trust
Given that drowning prevention is a safety-critical domain, interpretability and trust are essential system requirements. 
Users must understand why a warning is issued in order to respond effectively.

For this reason, the research prioritizes models and logic that can be clearly explained, evaluated, and validated by domain experts.

### 8. Future Directions
Future work may involve:
- Integration of real-time meteorological data sources
- Validation using real-world environmental datasets
- User studies involving lifeguards or safety professionals
- Extension of the system toward wearable or augmented reality interfaces

### 9. Research Orientation
This work is intended as applied academic research with a strong emphasis on real-world relevance. 
It is designed to serve as a foundation for further academic study as well as potential development into a practical safety support system.
